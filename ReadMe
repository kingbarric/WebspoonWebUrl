Context path: /snippet

Request Json Model (used for post and put method):
{
	"name": "Test",
	"expiryDate" : "5",
	"snippet" : "My Test Snippet"
}

expiryDate variable is an integer because it will be used to set the LocalDateTime from Java 8 lib to update the expiry seconds.
In the SnippetModel, i set expiry date as a method, and i have a method to set if its valid depending on the time range.
The boolean isValid helps to determine a valid url.
